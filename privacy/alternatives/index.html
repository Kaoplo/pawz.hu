        <h2>The best steps to take</h2>
        <p>Ditch Google Chrome, Opera GX, Edge, basically anything based on chromium and switch to either a hardened Firefox profile or librewolf.
        <br>You can create a hardened Firefox profile <a href="https://ffprofile.com/" target="_blank">here</a> or download LibreWolf <a href="https://librewolf.net/" target="_blank">here.</a> Librewolf is easier and faster to get running.</p>
        <p>Next step would be to ditch the Google search engine entirely. Google is known to censor and manipulate search results a lot, so it's best to avoid it. Some good alternatives are <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> or <a href="https://search.brave.com">Brave search</a>, but the best option is to self host SearXNG or use <a href="https://search.pawz.hu">my instance.</a></p>
        <p>These simple steps makes it much more difficult for advertising companies to spy on you, and they barely impact your experience on the internet. But if you wanna go further, keep reading.</p>
        <h2>Going further</h2>
        <p>Doing these next steps may heavily impact your experience on the internet, and also require deeper knowledge on computers and the internet.</p>
        <p>At this point you'd wanna avoid anything Google related, ditch most social media, and mostly use open source software. It might also be a good idea to ditch Windows as well and switch to Linux or another UNIX-like operating system. Basically anything that's closed source cannot be trusted that it's not stealing your data or spying on you.</p>
