        <h2>Why it's bad</h2>
        <p>There's a lot of reasons why protecting your privacy on the internet is important. Some would say that "I'm not doing anything bad on the internet, I don't care if they look at what I do.", the problem is that this is a lot deeper than that.</p>
        <p>The amount of data Google, Meta, Amazon etc. collect from you is insane, they know you better than your parents or best friends.</p>
        <h3>Advertising</h3>
        <p>They use this data to target you with ads, and they're really good at it. They know what you like, what you don't like, what you're interested in, what you're not interested in, and they use this to make you buy stuff you don't need.
        <br>They also sell this data to other companies, and they use it to target you with ads as well.</p>
        <h3>Morality</h3>
        <p>Are you okay with someone, or a corperate entity tracking every move of yours, knowing everything about you, your hobbies, your activities, when you sit down to watch TikTok?
        <br>Are you okay with them looking at your conversations, using them to learn about you, or teach some ai?</p>
        <h3>Manipulation</h3>
        <p>If you know a friend well enough, you'll start to find ways to find ways to manipulate said friend. Of course if you're a good person, you'd never actually do any of this, but a corporate entity does not have to fear such moralities. As I mentioned earlier, they already know a lot about you, it is only a matter of time until they develop some sort of AI to make use of this data. Perhaps this could be considered the most important part about protecting your online privacy.    
        <br>Google already has manipulated/censored results for it's search engine, China already has a very controversial system in place that completely defeats privacy, if we don't do anything against this, if we don't rebel, it's only gonna get worse.
        <br>AI makes mistakes, it always does and always will. You probably don't want to be framed for a crime you didn't do because of some AI.</p>
    
        <h2>What's next?</h2>
        <p>If after all of that you're still not convinced, that's fine, it's your choice, wether you want to participate in this. For the rest of us taking some small simple steps already goes a long way in sending a message, and preventing data collection.</p>
